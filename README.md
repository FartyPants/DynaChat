# HistoryChat
WebUI extension for structured chat where you can change the history (previous responses) at any time

{WIP}

This is another experiment at doing chat where each turn is saved as a history (that you can re-arrange, change, or remove)
It comes from tweaking the BlockWrite - but more oriented as a chat.

So basically at any time you can change both prompt or the generated text by simply overwritting it, or regenerating it, or both, which will then change the history that goes to LLM for next turn.

You can specify how much last history to include or just switch it off (briefly)

Entire conversation can be rendered into full text

or JSONL

Again, since you can change anything at any time, this will reflects the generated text.
